# CodeWriter-WinUI
Win2D-based code editor for WinUI 3.

At this stage, this is only a proof of concept. 
I tried to port https://github.com/PavelTorgashov/FastColoredTextBox line by line which was a huge pain so I had to stop. The codebase is just too huge and hard to read.

I took some inspiration and created my own Win2d-based control. Feel free to contibute! Would be nice to have a fast full-featured for WinAppSDK / MAUI!
